Email validation
Project Title: 
Email Validation Tool

Project Description:
The Email Validation Tool is a Python-based application designed to validate and verify the correctness of email addresses according to a set of predefined rules. This tool serves as a helpful utility for ensuring that the provided email addresses adhere to standard email format guidelines and specific criteria outlined by the project requirements.

Key Features:

Interactive and Batch Modes:
Interactive mode allows users to input an email address during runtime for immediate validation.
Batch mode enables users to validate multiple email addresses at once by incorporating the tool into other scripts or applications.

Comprehensive Validation Rules:
Validates the presence of the "@" symbol.
Ensures there is only one "@" symbol in the email address.
Checks for consecutive "@" symbols and rejects them.
Verifies the correct placement of the "@" symbol.
Validates the local part of the email address for allowed characters, length, and consecutive usage.
Verifies the domain part for a valid domain name, hyphen restrictions, and minimum top-level domain length.
Checks for the correct separation of the local and domain parts with a dot (".").
Restricts certain characters and patterns in the email address, such as icon characters, consecutive punctuation, etc.

IP Address Validation:
Recognizes and validates IPv4 addresses as a valid form of email domain.

User-friendly Interface:
In interactive mode, the tool provides a user-friendly interface by prompting the user to enter an email address.
Generates clear messages indicating whether the email address is valid or not.

Example Usage:
Interactive Mode:
User is prompted to enter an email address.
The tool validates the entered email address and provides feedback to the user.

Batch Mode:
The tool can be integrated into other scripts or applications for bulk email validation.
Returns validation results for each email address in the batch.

Dependencies:
The project relies on Python (version 3.x) and utilizes the re module for regular expressions.

Future Enhancements:
Integration with external databases or APIs for additional email validation checks.
Support for internationalized email addresses (UTF-8 encoding).
Improved handling of specific corner cases or edge scenarios.

Conclusion:
The Email Validation Tool is a versatile and robust utility for ensuring the accuracy and conformity of email addresses. Its modular design allows for easy integration into various applications and scripts, making it an essential tool for data quality and user input validation.
